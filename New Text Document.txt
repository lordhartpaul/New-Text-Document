-- what is abstract in java.
-- interface vs abstract. That is only the reason or is there anything
-- Multiple Inheritance. If you want to extend one more class or interface?
-- Exact use of interface. That is one way of implementation. Not feature
-- why we have to declare abstract methods. Directly we can implement why we have to declare interface or abstract method. when to use abstract class and when to use interface.
-- In abstraction can user see the classes
-- Suppose I have one class in that I have one abstract method and one default method. Is that class is valid or not.
-- Polymorphism. Example. Compile time vs Run time Polymorphism.
-- suppose i have one class and one interface. My class implements that interface.
   I will develop one method in my class based on the interface method. Here i want to access the 
   method which i have created for that i used whatever the interface class if suppose class A is interface
   class B is the normal class. Class B implements Class A. Here can i create the object Class A = new Class B.
   Is there any exception JVM throws.
   Can Class A hold class B. What is the difference between holding and creating class A = new class B.

saves the memory space. Prime minister of a country. Problem is if for example many classes demanded for the same instance at the same time it cannot respond back all of them at same time. so the concept of concurrency, parallelism or multi programming doesn't fit and our application starts working little slow.
Mostly used in multi-threaded and database application. For example in MS Word whenver we type some word a single instance in the background continously check for correct spelling of word from database.
Advantage is only single instance is reused again and again.
To achieve singleton we have to follow the steps
1. Private constructor
2. getInstance menthod
3. Declaring public getInstance
4. Declaring static getInstance (used to call the class name with dot operator we use static; since we have declared constructor as private object will be not created so that we have to go for static)
5. getInstance return type should be same as class
6. The object we are returning should be member variable member ref.var(Private P p)
7. Declaring that object as static mem.variable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  8. correct instantiation(p = new P())

Tell me something about your last project you did. How you are using the web services in your project. Have you used any tools to test the web services.
What are webservices.
what is your understanding of RESTful web services.
soap webservices vs RESTful webservices. 
Name some of the commonly used HTTP methods used in REST based architecture.
What is URI. What is purpose of a URI in REST based webservices.
what is wsdl file.


-- Explain the architecture of microservices.
-- what are the differences between service oriented architecture, monolithic application and a microservice.
-- what are the steps you need to follow to migrate from monolithic architecture to micro service architecture.
-- what are the advantages and drawback of using micro service based architecture.
-- You have many microservices suppose if any microservice if failing how you will come to know and how you will debug that.
-- How a user interact with the first microservices.
-- What is the procedures to configure or integrate microservice with spring boot.
-- what is service discovery all about.
-- Can you give an example of microservice.
-- How do you configure the server port for microservice.



-- we are writing restful webservices for any functionality. POSTMAN
-- webservices - Something that is build and been deployed somewhere and you can use it through internet
-- Restful webservices - The different HTTP methods like PUT, POST, DELETE we will be using.
-- SOAP webservices - All the XML related thing will be there. WSDL is there.
-- URI - It's a resource identifier or locator. 

-- Persistent class - Means something that can be saved. Like that is stored in DB.
-- Hibernate - It's a ORM tool. In JDBC we used to connect to DB and write the whole sql query. 
   In hibernate it's all object oriented thing. So if i created a user object and i want to save that so i have to write simply user.save. And the internal work is done by hibernate.
   It's a mapping between the DB and object oriented thing.
-- Core interface - session, mapping file, session factory, transaction. From session facory we create session and we create transaction and write queries.
-- Functionalities supported - Any sql query like update, save, delete is done by hibernate
-- session factory - It is used to create a session object. It is thread safe.
-- session object - To maintain single session between DB and java.
-- Hibernate caching - 2 level caching is there. session is by default and besic level caching.
-- Cascade attribute - whenever we want to delete cascading is done or not in that particular case. Like 2 tables are connected so all the things related to that table or the related table needs to be deleted or not.
-- Get vs Load method - If we hit a DB one will return error and another one will not return any error
-- Lazy loading - Until and unless we get a fetch it wont get the data. That is Lazy.
-- Association mapping - one to one, one to many, many to many, many to one.
-- one to one - How 2 tables are related. one to many - for example user can have multiple addresses that is one to many. Like one employee can work on different departments. Many to many - Department will also have many employees.
-- Hibernate configuration with spring - In hibernate mapping file we specify all the dialects like for eg sql things we have to specify dialect, username, password, what type of sql we are creating.
-- log4j - Moved to logback. we have to add log jars in the pom. Then we have to create the log property file for eg if we are using logback then logback.property file in our application. Inside the class what we do is we create a logger and simply write logger.info or logger.debug

-- Custom bean - @bean and autowire it or @component
-- @configuration - used to define the configuration class
-- Inject a bean - If we are using xml kind of configuration, in that case we define a bean over there we can specify the exact date what we want to inject
-- Spring boot container - contains in bult container
-- Swagger - used for documentaion, explanation and example. If i created an API and i want to tell you what are the request parameter are there, what will be the output so for documentation purpose.
-- restcontroller - used for restful API's. 
-- component - It's a general stereotype. We are telling the container this is the bean.
-- Autowired - Suppose we have a class A and it contains contains class B and it has particular variable of class B. Inside the class A if i am writing @autowired at the top of where we define the variable bean. so i am telling the container to autowire or map this. so whenver A requires the object B the container will give it.
-- Indexes in DB - used to make query faster
-- Life cycle methods of bean - Initialization, pre initialization, populate the properties, factory awareness, post initialization, bean name awareness.
-- Constructor Injection - Injecting the bean at the time of initialization. Setter injection - After creation if it sets the object.
   whenever we can't create a particular object of the class without its dependency in that case we should go with constructor injection. If a class is created without its dependency in that case we can go for setter injection.
-- sort an array - array.sort
-- Comaparable - By default natural sorting order.
-- ArrayList - used for fetching purpose. LinkedList - used for manipulation purpose. Links are there so it is bit faster.
-- Abstraction - Hiding the implementation. Like we define interface and at client side we say you can call this interface or you can call this particular method but its implementation is not been given to you.
-- Abstract class - If you are defining abstract class you have to inherit it before initialization and write its implementation. Have both abstract & non abstract method.
-- why and when we need abstract - Suppose i have a general card class and there are n number of sub classes so specific functionality will be given in sub class and suppose nothing general is there so in that case we cant define anything in default method in that case we can go for abstract method. So defing a particular signature, so end user knows this should be the input and this should be the output. So exact implementation will go in the subclass. So if it is a debit card the implementation will be different if it is a credit card.
-- Interface - In Interface there is no default implementation. In abstract class implementation is allowed.
   In subclass there can be n number of implementation of interface but we can extend only a single super class. If you want to define different different interfaces and we can have a single class implementing all these interfaces it is possible. But if we define multiple classes and extend all those classes that is not possible.
-- Encapsulation - combining the data and methods together and hiding its implementation from outside misuse by defining access modifiers. So if it is private only that particular class can access and if it is public then some outside can use it.
   If we do not implement getter setter - In that case depending upon the access modifier of that particular variable for eg public variable we can directly use object.particular name of the variable that can be accessed outside.
   we dont want the variable to be accessed from anywhere.
-- Polymorphism - Compile time(Overloading) - Having the same method but the signature is different. For eg adding two variable add int int so these two inetegers will be added. same class having different signature maybe you can say type or number of argument is changed.
   Run time - Having a super class and having a sub class. And both the classes having same method and same signature. And at the run time we are deciding whether super class method is to be called or sub class method is to be called.

-- Abstract - In abstract we dont provide the body and for the implementation the concrete class will be responsible for providing the body of that abstract class. So there is abstract layer which we will give to the client. So the implementation is hidden.
-- Abstract class - May or may not have a abstract method. Abstract method - Method without a body.
-- Interface - A class can implement multiple interfaces. Abstract class - No multiple inheritance is possible. we can have constructor and private or normal variables but with interface we cannot have.
-- Multiple inheritance - Class impementing multiple interfaces.
-- Encapsulation - we have a class and there are attributes. And you want those attributes to be accessed by getter setters. So these attributes needs to be private and they are accessed with getter setters. Whenever any other class calls this class so when it creates the object only then we can change it.
   If we do not implement getter setter - we declared the variable as private so they will not be accessible outside the class. By making the variable public like the attributes of the class public. Suppose if there is any flag associated with the class you want the actual implementation to be hidden as i am declaring it as a private boolean towards this flag. But i want this variable to be changed only when the object is created. Default value has to be used everytime even if other class creates the object then only it can change.
-- Polymorphism - Run time - Overriding is done in the parent child hierarchy. You have method but there parameter is also same and name is also same.
   Compile time - Done within the class. when you have same method name but different parameters are there.
   Advantage - At runtime if you want to give the body of any class like child class method to be executed or method to be overriden.

-- When to use Interface and abstract - Depends on business need. If i have to get the full privilege to define my own custom functionality then i will be implementing interface.
-- Polymorphism - More than one form. 

-- Abstract class - Class which is abstract where the child class has to give the implementation and we cannot directly instantiate the abstract class. Abstract method - Method where there is no body definition only the declaration.
-- Encapsulation - Putting the methods, reference variable and primitive data types within a class structure. And giving proper access specifier to the class.
   If we do not implement getter setter - In the setter method if we want to do some additional thing like instead of directly setting the variable If we want to give the implementation in that way. So that is one purpose. Suppose i hava a int a and in the setter method i want to add 10 to it. So that can be only achieved by the setter method.
-- Polymorphism - Multiple implementation of any methods or any arguments which we pass in the runtime.
   Compile time - we tell the compiler which method to be called at the compile time based on the match between what we pass and what is there in argument.
   Run time - Invoking any child class method via parent refernce variable. The actual instance is passed.
   Advantage - Code reusability, loose coupling - we can access any child class method using parent reference variable.
-- How to override a method - we need to extend the base class and we can provide the implementation in the child class.
-- Inheritance - Concept of parent class and child class. All the methods and attributes of a parent class is accessible to the child class.
   Types - Multi level, Multiple, Hierarchial, Hybrid, single.

-- Abstract - Not showing the implementation part only showing the signature.
-- Abstract method - Have only the signature. It wont be having the content in it. we just create a method with the signature it wont be having logic inside. We wont define the method.
-- Interface - It was full abstraction before java 8 but in interface now we have default method. In interface all the methods are public, static, abstract by default in the method. We wont be having any implementation to that method we wont be having any logic inside that method we just define the method with the signature.
-- Polymorphism - Multiple occurence. 
   Compile time - we have discrete method with the different signature that is we pass different parameters. The check happens at the compile time.
   Run time - If you want to use parent class method, the signature and method name will be different but we can change the logic inside that method.

-- When to use Interface and abstract - Interface is required basically when we dont need to provide any definition to any method we just need to give the declaration basically for eg so this is the calculate method, area method. This method will be define in the interface and the explicit implementation class will give the body of this method.
  Abstract Class - If i want something which should be already defined and the implemented class should not give the definition in that case we go for abstract class. And those definition we will be giving to the abstract method.
  So if i want to write something once and i want to use it in many places then we will go for abstract class and abstract method. While i want to give a generic definition and want to use at multiple places then we will go for interface.
-- Polymorphism - Providing many forms of the same object.
   Compile time - Name of the methods are same in the same class but differences with the signature like what will be the return type, parameter.
   Run time - Having same name of the method with same return type and same parameter within the subclass as well as the superclass.
   Advantage - For eg if i want to calculate the area of the square and parameter the name area is same but the parameter and return type is different in that scenario we can go for polymorphism.
-- If we do not implement getter setter - we write the program and there are multiple times when we provide the values to the variable at runtime so getter setter make sure that the type of the variable should be same. This is the particular type acceptable by this method. Getter setter makes sure this is the type of the variable. It defines the definition of abstraction, we are assigning values to the variable should be separate from where i am assigning this value like it should be hidden from the user that what value it is going to write. So that is the reason we keep it in separate class and encapsulate with getter setter.
-- Static - Keyword that makes sure that one should not need to create the object to access this method or static member. 
-- Constant - pi vale 3.14 which doesn't change in that case we use constant.

Lambda expression - Enable functional programming

Throws - to suppress the exception; used for compile time exception; multiple exceptions we can throw; used with the method
Throw - Explicitly if you want to create an exception object manually; used for runtime exception; only single eception we can throw; used inside the method

Optionals - with the help of optionals we can specify alternate value to return. If we want to print odd number from a list of number but there is no odd numbers then we can use optionals. Alternative to if else
varchar - distinguish between the null annd empty string
varchar2 - doesn't distinguish between the null and empty string
wrapper class - used to convert the primitive data types to object. Eg. int to Interger
RequestMapping - used at class level
GetMapping - used at method level; used to map the HTTP GET request
External Iterator - programmer has control over the logic; If we want these thing to be printed we just specify the logic and the way
Internal Iterator - forEach we will use. we just specify what is to be done not how it is to be done
ways to create thread - by extending thread class and overriding the run metod & by implementing runnable interface by including run method
Features - we can define methods in interface, more focus on behaviour of object which is function, when we work with collection, database we need stream api to make sure we don't have concurrency and mutation. when multiple threads sharing the same variable then it leads to concurrency.
Stream filter - if you want to filter and get only odd numbers than we use it
Stream map - if you want to convert a value into another value. If we have list a value 1 to 10 and you want multiply each value we can use map
Stream map to int - if you want to convert all the double value to the integer value
Stream - once we use a value we can't reuse it
Serialization - converting the object state to persistent state. If you want to store the state of an object into a file we need to use serializable
CotrollerAdvice - used to handle exception in spring boot using ExceptionHandler annotation
